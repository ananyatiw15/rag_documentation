  operational_terms:
    - term: overdue_jobwork
      definition: Jobwork past its delivery date but not yet completed
      context: Operational management and escalation trigger
      calculation: Current_date > delivery_date AND status NOT IN (Completed, Cancelled)

    - term: grn
      definition: Goods Receipt Note documenting materials received from vendors
      context: Output material flow tracking and quality control entry point
      full_form: Goods Receipt Note
      triggers: [inventory_update, qc_process, payment_processing]

  financial_terms:
    - term: jobwork_total
      definition: Final calculated amount for jobwork including all line items and adjustments
      context: Used for vendor payments and cost accounting
      components: [line_item_totals, adjustments, taxes, discounts]
    
    - term: rate_variance
      definition: Difference between planned and actual rates for jobwork items
      context: Cost control and vendor negotiation
      acceptable_range: "Usually within ±5% of agreed rates"
