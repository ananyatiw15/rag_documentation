intent: material_flow_tracking
description: >
  Track complete material flow lifecycle for jobworks including delivery challans sent to suppliers, 
  GRNs received back, quantity reconciliation, and quality status. This provides end-to-end visibility 
  of material movement from dispatch to receipt with variance analysis.
