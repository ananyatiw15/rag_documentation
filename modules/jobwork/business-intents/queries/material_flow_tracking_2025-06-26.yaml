intent: material_flow_tracking
description: >
  Track material flow from jobwork creation through delivery challan dispatch to GRN receipt. 
  This provides visibility into the complete supply chain flow for manufacturing operations, 
  helping teams monitor material movement and identify bottlenecks.
