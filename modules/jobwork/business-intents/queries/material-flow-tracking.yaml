performance_notes:
  - "Complex subqueries may impact performance on large datasets"
  - "Indexes on JobworkLinkedResources improve join performance"
  - "Consider materialized views for frequently accessed data"

  - "Vendor delivery analysis"

validation_rules:
  - "JobworkId must exist and be active"
  - "Material flow data depends on linked delivery challans and GRNs"
